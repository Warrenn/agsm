# agsm
agsm is a modular state management framework. AGSM attempts to reduce the boilerplate that plague sate management frameworks by adopting an API first design approach. Its framework agnostic and has been tested on Vue <<version information>>, Angular <<version information>> and React <<version information>>. 

# prinicples

- copy on write
  
- autofreeze
- modular state isolation
- isolation of transformation concerns from asyncronous invocations
- chain of responsibility hooks for transformations as well as invocations
- seperate composition phase from process cycle
- tell dont ask consumer
- written from the perspective of intended usage in mind first then algorithm next
- modular scopes through namespaces
- state machine logic flow
- dependency injection through factory methods
- scope targeting
